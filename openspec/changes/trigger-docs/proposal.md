## Why

Phases 1-3 added open config block, cron triggers (K8s CronJob), and queue triggers (NATS). Documentation and skill files need to be updated to reflect these new capabilities so developers can use them effectively.

## What Changes

- Update architecture docs with triggers section, config block, K8s resources
- Create roadmap doc for future enhancements
- Update skill file with trigger types, NATS config, lifecycle
- Update deployment guide with trigger deployment details

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `trigger-docs`: Comprehensive documentation for all trigger types, config block, and deployment lifecycle

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- None -->

## Impact

- `docs/architecture.md`: Updated with triggers, config block, CronJob resources
- `docs/roadmap.md`: NEW — future enhancements
- `pipedreamer-skill/SKILL.md`: Trigger types, NATS config, lifecycle
- `pipedreamer-skill/references/deployment-guide.md`: Full trigger deployment guide
